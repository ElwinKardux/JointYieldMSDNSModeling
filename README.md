# JointYieldMSDNSModeling
Joint modeling of the nominal and real yield using Markov-Switching Dynamic Nelson-Siegel models

* **main.m:**
Main file which initializes all the parameters, optimizes the log-likelihoods of the JDNS, the MSL-JDNS and the MSS-JDNS. Also provides code for the smoothed factor plots.

* **NegLogLike.m:**
Function of the log-likelihood for the JDNS.

* **NegLogLikeLambda.m:**
Function of the log-likelihood for the MSL-JDNS.

* **NegLogLikeSigmas.m:**
Function of the log-likelihood for the MSS-JDNS.

* **DNS.m:**
Function that takes in the JDNS parameters ($f$, $\alpha$, $\lambda$, $p$, $q$, $\mu$) and returns the state-space formulation parameters ($H, F, R, Q, d_t$).

* **Loadings\_Joint.m:**
Function that inputs $\alpha$, $t$ and $\lambda$, and returns the Nelson-Siegel factors loadings ($H$).

* **V\_Prob.m:**
Multinomial Normal log-likelihood function, with inputs: forecast error and its variance.

* **Liabilities/utils.py:**
File containing helper functions that we use to price the liabilities via the JY model.

* **Liabilities/main\_derivative\_pricing.py:**
Running this file will provide the values of the liabilities for all years corresponding to the liabilities of NN Leven.

* **Liabilities/main\_hull\_white\_model\_v2.py**
In this file, we run the Hull-White model which provides the $a_n$ term corresponding to the mean reversion of the inflation curve.

* **Yield\_Simulating/bonds\_fund\_portfolio\_mss\_1.py:**
Creates the investment strategy and obtains the results of Table 5.


If you want to run the **Yield\_Simulating/bonds\_fund\_portfolio\_mss\_1.py** file, you have to import the QSTrader package first. The download link and the details on this package can be found in https://github.com/mhallsmoore/qstrader.
